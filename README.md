# Domino SBT Project Template

This repo is an evolving view into what we think makes the start for a successful project at Domino. It does its best to provide some useful and sane defaults for the following:

1) Modern `built.sbt`
2) Build/release/deploy scripts for CI to run
3) Scalastyle sane defaults
4) Best-practice compiler options
